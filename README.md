Redmine Wiki: Next Generation plugin (WikiNG) adds some new and useful extentions to Redmine Wiki syntax. Among them are:

* Warning, notice and tip blocks;
* TODO, FIXME, UPDATE, NEW and FREE markers;
* External Wiki links to Wikipedia, Google etc;
* Smileys including (!) and (?);
* Conditional macros allowing to disable/enable content depending on date or project version;
* CSS classes, which can be used in Wiki.
